This tool is for generating the required RGB values for normal mapping

![Image Missing :(](wheel.png)

Usage:
1. Copy wheel.png and paste it into any image editor.
2. Use the terminal text input to enter the angles on a sphere you want and get back an RGB value. Good for getting precise and consistent values.

Notes:
1. The program will only close when you finish typing in the text input, even if you press the X. Just spam enter.
2. There is no windows build because this langauge's cross compiler does not work.
3. There is no linux build because you guys can do it yourselves.

Todo:
1. Somehow compile a windows build
2. Disallow window resizing or make the circle fill the viewport
3. Reduce refresh rate (currently vsync)
